### Project Description
"‡¥®‡µÄ ‡¥é‡¥®‡µç‡¥±‡µÜ ‡¥û‡¥æ‡µª ‡¥®‡¥ø‡¥®‡µç‡¥±‡µÜ" (You are mine, I am yours) is a fully client-side web application designed for animals in Kochi to find companionship. It allows for the creation of detailed pet profiles, a system for liking other profiles, and a celebratory notification for successful mutual matches. The entire experience runs directly in the user's browser, with all data stored locally.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In the vibrant city of Kochi, a silent crisis looms: pet loneliness. Our beloved cats, dogs, crows, and cows lead lives of quiet solitude, watching their human companions navigate the world of dating. Why should humans have all the fun? This project tackles the pressing issue of existential dread among the single, non-human population of Kerala.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built a revolutionary social platform for animals to find their "jeeva-pankali" (life partner). The solution allows users to:

Create a Profile: A multi-step form lets users build a detailed profile for their pet, listing their species, diet, and unique hobbies.

Act as a User: A persistent "Active Profile" session allows the user to browse and interact as one of their created animals.

Like and Match: Users can "like" other profiles. When two profiles like each other, a "Successful Match" is declared with a celebratory pop-up.

View Matches: A dedicated "My Successful Matches" page shows all the mutual matches for the active profile, creating a permanent record of their romantic success.

## Technical Details
The project is a serverless, client-side application, meaning it requires no backend or internet connection to function after the initial load.

System Architecture: The application's "system" is the user's web browser. It relies entirely on built-in Browser APIs for logic and data storage.

Data Persistence (localStorage): The primary "database" is the browser's localStorage. All created profiles, their likes, and messages are stored here, ensuring the data persists even after the browser is closed.

Session Management (sessionStorage): To create an immersive user experience without a real login, the "Active Profile" is stored in sessionStorage. This keeps the user "logged in" as a specific animal for their current session.

### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
Languages: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6)

Frameworks: Tailwind CSS for all styling.

Core Logic: All user interactions, profile rendering, the matching algorithm, and data handling are managed by Vanilla JavaScript.
